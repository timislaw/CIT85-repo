            <h3>Water Location</h3>
            <p>We responsibly locate and tap into ground water to help monitor the water table.</p>
    
            <h3>Sustainable Water Levels</h3>
            <p> In hopes of understanding how much water is available, we can better plan for the future.</p>

            <h3>Installing Wells</h3>
            <p>During drilling, we go to the predicted depth to where the water table is and sample to see if soil meets saturation. Typically, you can tell by liquefaction of the soil, otherwise both soil and water will be more separated.</p>
            <p>Once water levels are reached, we pull out the borings/augers and begin to install casing/pipes followed with sand to help filter out soil. This leads to a secured well for monitoring usage.</p>

            <h4>Tim's Boaring Beginning</h4>
            <p>During drilling, I noticed a lot of clients and drilling companies had become irresponsible with usage of water and handling of contaminants. I wanted to make a change to help prevent misuse of our available water tables and help build awareness of potential contamination and how to avoid it.</p>

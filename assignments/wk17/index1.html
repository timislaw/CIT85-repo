                <h1>Age of Sail</h1>
                <small>Tim Ross</small>
                <p>Until the middle of the 19th century, sailing ships were the primary means for marine exploration, commerce, and projection of military power; this period is known as the Age of Sail. Sailing ships are an ancient technology, making far reaching trade like the ancient spice trade possible. As the Age of Steam came about, so began the end of this art of sailing.</p>

                <p>Prior to the introduction of compasses, geographical position and direction at sea were determined by landmarks, and positioning of celestial bodies. There were many other methods such as flight paths of birds, wind observation, sea state, and even mud sampling from the sea floor. So when the compass was invented during the Han Dynasty in China, it impacted the world and forever changed navigation. I think the importance of the compass, the tranquility of being at sea, the skill of sailing, and the history of it within almost every culture is why sailing draws so many people to it today.</p>
